**Br√∂sel**

Brosel is a minimal [bun](https://bun.sh) fullstack framework. It's supporting SSR. To support us, please star the [repo](https://git.new/brosel).

To get started, either create routes at the `/src/pages` folder or edit src `src/index.ts` to add own routes/rules. You can read the docs [here](https://git.new/brosel/docs).

Happy hacking!
