Br√∂sel is german for "crumbs", and this is describing this framework really well. It's aiming to be as tiny as possible, and fully lives inside your application. It's not installed as a dependency with npm, you just run the cli to install the neccessary files. Like shadcn/ui as framework.

It's made for bun, and it's not made to be used outside of bun. You have to **use bun** to use it, you can install [bun here](https://bun.sh).
